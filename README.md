This is a 3D Printed Straight Morse Code Key. It has been designed to closely match the conventional J-38 style keys of yesteryear. 

This project was in response to the frankly, shocking price of basic straight keys available today. Yes, in my day sonny you could buy a cheap key from Radio Shack (May they rest in peace) fow a few dollars. 

I looked at some of the keys currently available on Thingiverse.com, the giant 3D model repository and was inspired by a design from NA8E, so it was off to Solidworks and about 5 revisions later we have the current design.....still subject to change. 

One of the unique features about this model is the center beam may be printed in conductive plastic which moves the contact wiring to the back of the key for a neater appearance, but is not essential to get a working key. It also features spring tension adjust and contact gap adjust. 

The key does require some additional hardware such as a shoulder bolt, nut, two skate bearings and some 4-40 brass hardware. It will also require the sacrifice of a Pilot G-2 or similar pen for its spring. 

The hardware necessary for this includes:

2 686-ZZ Bearings 13mm OD, 6mm ID, 5mm Thick

1 6mm dia x 45mm shoulder bolt

1 M5 x 0.8 nylon insert nut (McMaster 90576A104)

4 4-40 narrow brass hex nuts (McMaster 95130A110)

3 Screw to expand brass inserts for 4-40 (McMaster 92395A315)

1 4-40 round head brass 5/16" screw (McMaster 94070A107)

1 4-40 round head brass 5/8" screw (McMaster 94070A112)

2 4-40 round head brass 1" screw (McMaster 94070A115)

I will have complete keys available for purchase from my web site K5ABL.com as well as just the hardware kits or a customized key printed with your call sign in the color of your choice.
